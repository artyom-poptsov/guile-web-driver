- add (send-keys label keys) helper
- add (selected? text) helper
- appium, so i can test touch events finally
- Complete all commands from specification
- with-web-driver should also accept arguments, or maybe just one, the driver?
- test-web-handler method, that installs the web server and navigates to it
- check if these bug are also present in the current chromedriver?
- report the bug to chromedriver:

crashes chromedriver

{"actions" : [{"id" : "keyboard0","type" : "key","actions" : [{"type" : "keyDown","value" : "a"}, {"type" : "pause","duration" : 100}, {"type" : "keyUp","value" : "a"}]}, {"id" : "mouse0","type" : "pointer","actions" : [{"type" : "pause","duration" : 0}, {"type" : "pause","duration" : 0}, {"type" : "pause","duration" : 0}]}]}

The pause between the keyDown and the keyUp event takes double the time, 200 milliseconds.

- wish: get-line should accept no argument to read from current input port
