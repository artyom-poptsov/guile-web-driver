{"actions" : [{"id" : "keyboard0","type" : "key","actions" : [{"type" : "keyDown","value" : "a"}, {"type" : "pause","duration" : 100}, {"type" : "keyUp","value" : "a"}]}, {"id" : "mouse0","type" : "pointer","actions" : [{"type" : "pause","duration" : 0}, {"type" : "pause","duration" : 0}, {"type" : "pause","duration" : 0}]}]}

The pause between the keyDown and the keyUp event takes double the time, 200 milliseconds.
