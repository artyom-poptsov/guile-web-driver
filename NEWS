* Version 1.0.0 (2024-08-03)
** Change the project name to Guile-Web-Driver-NG
"NG" stands for "Next Generation".  Not a very original name indeed, but it
helps to distinguish this fork from the original project.
** Migrate to GNU Autotools
This allows to build the project in a more convenient way.
** Implement an intercepting proxy
Implement an intercepting (MITM) proxy that allows to inspect and modify HTTP
and HTTPS requests/responses.

Special "interceptor chains" can be set for a proxy interceptor that allow to
apply different actions to requests and responses in sequence.  The design is
partly inspired by Linux iptables.  Each rule in a chain specifies a field to
process, an action to apply to the field and action parameters.  When a proxy
has no traffic interceptor it runs like a regular proxy that forwards traffic
between a client and a server.

Examples of proxy usage can be found in the Info documentation.
** Split =driver.scm= into several modules
** Add GNU Guix recipe
Now the latest version of the project can be built with
=guix build -f ./guix.scm=
** Add Info documentation
** Implement SRFI-64 tests
